# Computational Modeling of Cognition and Behavior
*SusTech BME — Machine Learning & NeuroEngineering (2021)*

A curated collection of **lecture slides** and **hands-on materials (Python/R)** for the *Computational Modeling of Cognition and Behavior* course at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). The goal is to help students understand and apply computational models to study human cognition and behavior.

## Overview
This repository hosts materials for **Machine Learning & NeuroEngineering** at SUSTech. It includes lecture slides (PDFs) and, where available, example code/snippets (Python/R) illustrating methods commonly used in cognitive and behavioral modeling:

- **Foundations of Computational Neuroscience & Machine Learning** — core neuro and ML concepts for modeling cognition and behavior.  
- **Neural Data Processing** — basic pipelines for EEG/BCI and probability/statistics for signal–noise reasoning.  
- **Bayesian Methods & Sampling** — priors/posteriors, MCMC, Gibbs/JAGS, and practical diagnostics.  
- **Deep Learning** — gradient descent, backpropagation, CNNs, hands-on training, and links to the visual system.
